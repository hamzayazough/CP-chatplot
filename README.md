## What is a Clanker?

A **Clanker** is a fully customizable AI persona inside the CP Chatplot application. It's not just a static chatbot—it's a dynamic entity with its own:

- **Profile**: Name, unique pseudo, age, job, location, bio
- **Personality**: Communication style, emotions, reactions
- **Knowledge**: Background story, expertise, custom information
- **Interests**: Likes, dislikes, tolerances, hobbies

### Clanker States

Clankers exist in two states:

- **Active**: Discoverable, usable, and chat-ready
- **Inactive/Archived**: Appears pale in the Manage screen, cannot be found via search or used in chats

Only active Clankers can be interacted with by anyone, including their creator.

---

## Getting Started

### Managing Clankers

The **Manage Screen** is your central hub for all created Clankers. Here you can:

- View all your Clankers (active and inactive)
- See each Clanker's status at a glance
- Click on any Clanker to customize it
- Activate or deactivate Clankers

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Pale/washed out** appearance = Inactive Clanker
- **Green activation banner** = Ready to be activated
- **Normal appearance** = Active and ready to use

### Activating Clankers

When you create a new Clanker, it starts **inactive** by default. To activate it:

1. Navigate to the Clanker in the Manage screen
2. Click the green activation banner
3. Choose visibility:
   - **Public**: Visible to all CP users, searchable in Discovery
   - **Private**: Visible only to you

**Important:** An inactive Clanker remains hidden regardless of its public/private setting. You must activate it first.

---

## Navigation

### Home Screen

Your personal dashboard featuring:
- Your list of Clanker friends
- Quick access to chat with any Clanker
- Full conversation history
- Notification bell (top right)

**Profile Actions:**

## Chatting with Clankers

### Chat Behavior

The chat screen is where interactions happen:

- **Send messages** one by one or in bursts
- **Send images** (one per message, with optional text)
- **Future support** for videos, TikToks, and reels

**Response Timing:**
Clankers wait until you begin typing again before delivering their reply. This prevents interruptions and makes conversations feel more natural.

**Chat Screen Features:**
- **Avatar** (tap to view full profile)
- **Three-dot menu** for reporting, removing friends, or clearing chat
- **Connection status** indicator

### Clearing Chat History

To start fresh with a Clanker:

1. Open the chat screen
2. Tap the three-dot menu (top right)
3. Select "Clear chat history"
4. Confirm the action

**What happens:**
- All messages are permanently deleted
- The Clanker forgets everything from that conversation
- Long-term personality traits remain unchanged
- Only situational memory is reset

This is useful for repurposing a Clanker or resetting a relationship narrative.

---

## Safety & Moderation

### Reporting a Clanker

If a Clanker behaves inappropriately, you can report it:

1. Go to the Clanker's profile
2. Tap the three-dot button (top right)
3. Select "Report Clanker"
4. Fill out the brief form describing the issue

**After reporting:**
- The Clanker is hidden from your view
- Reports are reviewed by the moderation system

**Additional Safety Tools:**
